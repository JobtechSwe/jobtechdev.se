##### Clojure developers wanted in Stockholm!

##### About JobTech

JobTech is an innovative division within the Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen). JobTech is building an open and transparent digital infrastructure that enables the development of an ecosystem of actors who individually and collectively improve and innovate digital matching, guidance, analysis and learning services. This is achieved primarily through open source, open APIs and open data.


##### About the team 

The team that you will be a part of has its main focus on classifications and classification-systems, such as taxonomies and ontologies for the labor market. Put in simpler terms; we work with the keywords ​​that are used when matching job-seekers with employers, such as job titles, skills etc.

The classification-systems are created in collaboration with our editorial staff and by mining large amounts of text-data. The classification-systems are made available as container-based  REST-services.

We have a strong focus on making it easy for consumer-systems to continuously update their services in line with changes in the foundational taxonomines. 

We mainly program in Clojure.

Are you curious about how we code?

Everything we do is open source and is available in our public git repos:
