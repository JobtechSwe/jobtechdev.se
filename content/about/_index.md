##### Jobtech development is part of the Swedish Public Employment Service. #####

We take the leap from the Swedish Public Employment Service's mission to contribute to a well-functioning labor market. We do this by offering open APIs and technology for those who, together with us, want to contribute to a well-functioning labor market.
This is what we define as an Ecosystem - a mutually dependent business network that offers innovation and production benefits to its members through electronic exchange.
##### Our target group #####
We are targeting the actors who develop digital services for the labor market area. It may be startups and established actors who want to build better services to help employers find the workforce and skills and job seekers a job.
