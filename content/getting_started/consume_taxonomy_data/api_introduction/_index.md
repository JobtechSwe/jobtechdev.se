In this example we build a basic application that will perform two subsequent API calls to find all occupation names that are close relatives to any occupation name of our choice.

We will solely utilize the JobTech Dev Taxonomy API to achieve this functional example. Follow along and you will have a working sample within just a couple minutes.

To acquire an API key, please follow guidelines in the [Obtain Keys](obtain_keys) page.
