This section covers the basics on how to fetch data from JobTech Dev APIs.

The very first step is to request an API key for the APIs that you're interested in.
Fill this form and you'll receive a key shortly.

We have prepared three getting started tutorials (including code samples) that will let you quickly consume data from our APIs.

- [Consume Job Ad Data](consume_job_ad_data)
- [Consume Taxonomy Data](consume_taxonomy_data)
- [Consume Forecast Data](consume_forecast_data)
