#### Licence for code

>
A permissive free software licence is a free software licence for a copyrighted work that offers freedoms such as publishing a work to the public domain.[1] In contrast, copyleft licences like the GNU General Public License require copies and derivatives of the source code to be made available on terms not more restrictive than those of the original licence.
>

[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

You can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices. This permissive licence contains a patent licence from the contributors of the code.

#### Licence for data
[Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)

Creative Commons CC0 licence means that the data is free to use, modify and share without any restriction. This is the default policy if nothing else is explicitly declared.
