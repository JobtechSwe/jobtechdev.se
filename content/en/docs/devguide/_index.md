description: "You who want to contribute to the ecosystem are our greatest asset. We believe in joint development and dialogue, and that the more people who collaborate and share information, the better solutions for everyone. This means that source code and information are free for all to use and develop as much as possible. Here you will find our example applications, built on our open APIs, projects that are open for co-development and some information about our key management and policies if you want to contribute.          
              Feel free to contact us with comments, questions or if you would like to help us out at jobtechdevelopment@arbetsformedlingen.se."
