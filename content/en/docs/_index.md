Open data is information that is available to anyone to use, reuse and share, so that others can develop it and create benefits for more. It is not possible to obtain data at the individual level via our open data. It is worth noting that we are working on letting the individual through his / her consent to retrieve his personal data from the Employment Service.
 We make no demands on use, but hope you make it easier for the right individual and the right employer to meet!"
