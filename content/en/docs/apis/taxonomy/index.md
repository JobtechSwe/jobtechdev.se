description: "**JobTech Taxonomy provides access to concepts and expressions used in the labor market as well as information on how these are linked to each other. This applies, for example, to job titles, competence concepts or the connection between professions and skills.
              The occupational names are structured according to the Standard for Swedish occupational classification (SSYK).** <br/> <br/>
              The API is useful for all companies and organizations that develop and offer digital matching services but do not have the opportunity to build an information structure on their own. Actors who study and analyze developments in the labor market also benefit from the API. <br/> <br/>
              **The API is freely available.** "
