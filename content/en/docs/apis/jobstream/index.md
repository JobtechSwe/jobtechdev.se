description: "**Job Stream provides access to all job advertisements published in Platsbanken, including real-time information about all changes that take place around or in these advertisements. The changes can be, for example, publications / depublications of advertisements or changes in the ad text.** <br/><br/>
                           The API is particularly useful for companies and organizations that have their own search engine and want to improve their service with real-time updated ad data. It is also useful for those who want to be able to identify and analyze trends in the labor market with the help of advertising data.
                           Developers who need access to large amounts of advertising data for algorithm training also benefit from the API. <br/> <br/>
                           **The API is freely available.**"
