description: "**Job Search makes it possible to search and filter among job advertisements that are published in the Swedish Public Employment Service's advertising platform Platsbanken.** <br/> <br/>
              The API is particularly useful for companies and organizations that do not have their own search engine, but who want to use job advertisements from Platsbanken.
              It is also useful for those who have access to large amounts of structured data and who want to be able to offer special search functions and niche advertising platforms to their target groups. <br/> <br/>
              **The API is freely available.** "
