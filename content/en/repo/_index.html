<h1>Transparency Policy</h1>
<p>This policy covers all projects run by the JobTech unit that is part of the Employment Service. JobTech makes open data available and enables the use of this data.
  The policy describes the employees of the unit JobTech's position regarding openness towards their users. Inspiration comes from Debian Social Contract. Comments are welcome.

  We are also committed to making it easy to contribute and use the open infrastructure.

<h4>Tax financing requires sharing</h4><br>
<p>
  The results of JobTech's operations benefit many if it is available and open. Open source is good for those who want to contribute to better services and for those who want to review the authority's activities.
  Where there is reason to limit transparency, no more than is necessary to exclude sharing.</p>
