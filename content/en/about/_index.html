We take the leap from the Swedish Public Employment Serviceâ€™s mission to contribute to a well-functioning labor market. We do this by offering open APIs and technology for those who, together with us, want to contribute to a well-functioning labor market. This is what we define as an Ecosystem - a mutually dependent network that offers innovation and production benefits to its members through electronic exchange.
