<h2>How we work with digital accessibility</h2>
<p>We strive for Arbetsförmedlingen's websites to be perceived, managed and understood by all users, regardless of need or disability and regardless of which aids you use.
    We must at least achieve basic accessibility by following<a href="https://webbriktlinjer.se/riktlinjer/1-utga-fran-wcag-2-1-niva-aa/"> WCAG 2.1 at level AA.</a>
    Work is underway to review the Swedish Public Employment Service's digital guidelines. To give our employees the right conditions and knowledge of digital accessibility, we place great focus on educating those who develop our digital services.
