Arbetsförmedlingen, The Swedish Public Employment Service, organization number: 202100-2114, is responsible for the jobtechdev.se website.

The following describes how the jobtechdev.se handles web cookies.

The policy covers all users of the jobtechdev.se website.

### What does it mean that a website uses cookies?

Anyone who visits a website that uses cookies must by law receive information that the site contains cookies, what they are used for and how you can opt out of them.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on the user's computer and contains information. Cookies are normally used to improve the site for you as a visitor. There are two types of cookies:

- A permanent cookie that remains on your computer for a pre-determined amount of time.
- A session-cookie which is temporarily store in memory for a certain duration or until the web browser is closed.

More information about cookies and the new law about electronic communication is available on [Post och Telestyrelsens website](http://www.pts.se).

### Approval of the use of cookies on the jobtechdev.se website

The use of cookies on Jobtechdev.se requires the consent of the user. By your explicit consent, you consent to the use of cookies on the website and the processing of personal data saved through the use of cookies. There is no possibility of denying consent to any or any cookies without the use being approved in its entirety.

### What happens if you deny the use of cookies on jobtechdev.se?

The Swedish Public Employment Service uses cookies for the website to function properly. If you choose to decline cookies through your browser settings, some services and features on the site may be affected.

If you do not want cookies to be used on your computer, you can change the setting in the browser security settings. In that case no cookies will be stored, but some functionality on the site might be unavailable to you. Important to keep in mind is that you cannot use the services that require login.

### What cookies are used when you visit jobtechdev.se?

We use cookies for the following purposes:

1. To improve the use of Jobtechdev.se. Cookies used for this purpose are exclusively so-called session cookies. The purpose of these cookies is to make the application work properly, for example, to know if a user is logged in and to keep the session running or to remember that the user has approved the cookie use or to enable a secure login to the software. These cookies may contain personal data (for example, for login cookies, the user's user name, normally his e-mail address, is written down in the temporary cookie and stands there as long as the person is logged in).
2. For web analytics with Google Analytics for the purpose of studying statistics and traffic flows. These cookies are usually of a permanent nature. Google Analytics also use session cookies in conjunction with access to the site without login. Upon access, a cookie (IP address) that is anonymized in Google Analytics is set. The user's identity is thus not known to the website. See below for more information on cookies for Google Analytics.

In addition, there are a number of cookies when Jobtechdev.se is active, but which we do not create or use ourselves:

1. When using third-party software (Youtube, Minio etc.), so-called third-party cookies are used of both the permanent cookies and session cookies. They are used, for example, to enable storing logos about logged in companies who choose to publish logos at Jobtechdev.se. They are also used for linking to social media if a company chooses to present their service via such media.
2. For advertising purposes. Google (not jobtechdev.se) use cookies that are usually of a permanent nature.

### More about Google Analytics

jobtechdev.se uses Google Analytics to create a picture of how visitors use the site.

The following cookies are created by Google Analytics

- **_ga** - In order for Google Analytics to determine that two separate hits belong to the same user, a unique identifier associated with that particular user must be sent with each hit. The analytics.js library does this via the Client ID field, a unique randomly generated string that is stored in the browser's cookies, so that subsequent visits to the same site can be associated with the same user. By default, analytics.js uses a single cookie named _ga to store client ID, but the cookie name, domain, and runtime can all be customized. Other cookies created by analytics.js include _gid, AMP_TOKEN, _gat and _gac_ <property-id>. These cookies store other randomly generated user ID and campaign information.
- **_gid** - As above.
- **_gat** - As above.
- **_gac** - As above.
- **AMP_TOKEN** - As above.

The information created by these cookies through the user's use of the site (including your IP address) is forwarded to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. The information is used to evaluate visitor statistics, for example in order to improve navigation and structure. Google may also transmit this information to third parties if required by law or if a third party processes the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate IP addresses with other data.

To further safeguard your privacy, IP anonymization will be used in the Google Analytics data collection. This means that the last digits of the IP number are masked, for example 193.188.156.xxx.
