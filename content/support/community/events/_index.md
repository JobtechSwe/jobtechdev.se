##### **Previous events** 

- **Meet us at The Linux Foundation – Open Source Summit in Lyon 28th-30th of October**  
Johan Linåker (University of Lund) and Jonas Södergren (JobTech Dev, Swedish Public Employment Office) will present an overview of the infrastructure and share a public-sector organization's rationale for sharing software as open source.  
Attendees will further get insights into the potential value and ways of extending collaboration and co-creation beyond open source software to also include related open data and standards. We will discuss how to incentivize both organizations and citizens to join such cross-sector collaboration, and how a public-sector
organization should best facilitate and enable the collaboration and development of this kind of infrastructure.
