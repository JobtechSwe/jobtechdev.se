Find opportunities for collaboration and innovation, develop and improve the Swedish labour market. 
We share and receive knowledge, experience and data. This is an arena where collaboration and relationship building through open source and open data is made reality, regardless if you’re a developer, innovator, CEO, student - or something else.


Meet us - We’re available if you want to meet us and talk about ideas or potential collaborations,  
send an email to [Josefin](mailto:josefin.berndtson@arbetsformedlingen.se) and we’ll sort something out.

There’s a dedicated Community Slack channel where you can find a lot of interesting discussions and members.
