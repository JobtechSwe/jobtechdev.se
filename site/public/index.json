The more actors who contribute, private as well as from the public sector, the better matching. Therefore, we would like to see more players in the labour market join.\nLow barrier to entry For developers, a digital infrastructure lower entry barriers by providing a shared foundation to use as a starting point for their own work. They also provide access to a prospective customer pool, which can find and transact with the app developers more easily through the platform than they could without it.\n1. Jobtech dev - Sharing assets that is hard to find, build or buy. 2. Jobtech store - A app store for the labour market end-users 3. Jobtech search - Opensource search service 4. Jobtech jobs - All jobs aggregated in one place 5. Jobtech myData - Making labour market competences available  Variety of services for end-users For end-users, a digital infrastructure can allow extreme levels of customization to their unique needs by enabling them to themselves mix-and-match apps that increase their personal utility of the platform.\n"

Take CV data as an example: It should be accessible for those who have an interest in reading or writing in the data but on the basis that the individual always has control of the information. Massive data sets collected by companies and authorities creates possibility to see patterns in the behavior of people, and create new products and services to create a new value. The data can also be used for other purposes for example monitoring or affect opinions in politics. To control a lot of individual data could mean a risk.\nPurpose  Protect the individual\u0026rsquo;s right to his data Empower the individual with control of his data  Accelerate innovation Our second goal is to enable innovation. To be able to in a better way collaborate and develop as powerful digital services as private startups. The private and the public sector should be able to collaborate in both development and with common infrastructure/ standards for increasing the public benefit. By enabling a “digital bureaucracy”, i.e. traceability and standardized communication, new more transparent and effective forms of governance can be established. This is about competitiveness for Sweden and EU, but basically it is primary about increased social benefits for the entire humanity. Opens source is a global movement and has the power to improve, both for small and large countries and organizations.
