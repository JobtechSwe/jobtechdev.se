All actors can easily contribute with their data and code - as well as take part of others\u0026rsquo;.\n  JobTech vision   Roles in an ecosystem Infrastructure builders, developers/organisations, and end-users, have unique needs and motivations for participating in an ecosystem.\nBetter matching For infrastructure builders (The Swedish Public Employment Service acts as one), building a digital infrastructure increases the efficiency in matching and stimulates the creation of more digital services.\nAll actors in the labour market can share data and collaborate. The more actors who contribute, private as well as from the public sector, the better matching. Therefore, we would like to see more players in the labour market join.\nLow barrier to entry For developers, a digital infrastructure lower entry barriers by providing a shared foundation to use as a starting point for their own work. They also provide access to a prospective customer pool, which can find and transact with the app developers more easily through the platform than they could without it.\n1. JobTech dev - Sharing assets that is hard to find, build or buy. 2. JobTech store - A app store for the labour market end-users 3. JobTech search - Opensource search service 4. JobTech jobs - All jobs aggregated in one place 5. JobTech myData - Making labour market competences available  Variety of services for end-users For end-users, a digital infrastructure can allow extreme levels of customization to their unique needs by enabling them to themselves mix-and-match apps that increase their personal utility of the platform.\n"

	"content": " MyData aims for individuals to have control over their own data.The JobTech MyData goal is a distributed and decentralized data storage for the labour market. Take CV data as an example: It should be accessible for those who have an interest in reading or writing in the data but on the basis that the individual always has control of the information. Massive data sets collected by companies and authorities creates possibility to see patterns in the behavior of people, and create new products and services to create a new value. The data can also be used for other purposes for example monitoring or affect opinions in politics. To control a lot of individual data could mean a risk.\nPurpose  Protect the individual\u0026rsquo;s right to his data Empower the individual with control of his data  Accelerate innovation Our second goal is to enable innovation. To be able to in a better way collaborate and develop as powerful digital services as private startups. The private and the public sector should be able to collaborate in both development and with common infrastructure/ standards for increasing the public benefit. By enabling a “digital bureaucracy”, i.e. traceability and standardized communication, new more transparent and effective forms of governance can be established. This is about competitiveness for Sweden and EU, but basically it is primary about increased social benefits for the entire humanity. Opens source is a global movement and has the power to improve, both for small and large countries and organizations. Simplify and increase the efficiency of career work by catalyzing the ecosystem around JobTech. New and better services for jobseekers and employers. Free and efficient cross-border mobility, reducing the cost of employers and an easier user experience.\nTransparency and collaboration Our goal is to be 100% transparent and we will put all code and documentation on Github. The meaning is to consolidate knowledge and increase collaboration with other initiatives working on the same thought. We would be very happy to get in contact with you and we will support you with our knowledge but also learn from yours.\nThe code By visualizing and practically show how ownership of your own data could work, it will become easier for others to take stand on the concept. We strive to reuse as much as possible for not inventing the wheel again. The project in influenced by Mydata.org\nThe architecture is divided into four subsystem:\n mydata-app: An app were the individuals handles their data.\n mydata-operator: A technical operator who granted an approval from the individual, manages the communication between the individual, the data snd an external service.\n mydata-cv: a sample service that reads /writes to the individual’s data after being allowed to. (Data Source and Data Sink)\n mydata-pds: secure data storage, only available for the individual. PDS stands for Personal Data Storage.\n  "

The content is continuously updated in consultation with actors in the labour market.\n  Components   Paradigm of the Future Our aim is for the labour market terminology observed via text analysis and data collection to help enrich the content of JobTech Taxonomy - but not without quality assurance. We believe that optimal results are achieved when a data driven approach meets an expert driven.\n Occupations and skills in Sweden Taxonomy API Ontology API  RoadMap  Migrate the JobTech Taxonomy into a new database and create new identifiers for all values in the Taxonomy Release a new API for the JobTech Taxonomy Release a new synchronizing mechanism to allow consumers to stay updated with the JobTech Taxonomy Merge the JobTech Ontology with the JobTech Taxonomy and create new identifiers for all values in the Ontology  "
