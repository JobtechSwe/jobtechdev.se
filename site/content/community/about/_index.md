#### The JobTech Community 

Find opportunities for collaboration and innovation, develop and improve the Swedish labour market.  
We share and receive knowledge, experience and data.
This is an arena where collaboration and relationship  
building through open source and open data is made reality, 
regardless if you're a developer, innovator, CEO, student - or something else

##### How to join? 

Meet us - We're available if you want to meet us and talk about ideas or potential collaborations, just send us an email <josefin.berndtson@jobtechdev.se>     
Open source - You can contribute directly to our actual development [projects](https://github.com/jobtechswe) 



##### Everything in life is give and take - even JobTech 
We believe that open source is the way to go regarding digital innovation in the Swedish labour market.
We're happy to provide you with whatever  
we can to make your ideas a reality, but we also expect you to give back in some form. 
There are many ways to share your ideas and expertise  
in our ecosystem in order to give back.   

Share code, share knowledge, share data, every contribution counts! 
Let's talk and find something that fits and feels good.
