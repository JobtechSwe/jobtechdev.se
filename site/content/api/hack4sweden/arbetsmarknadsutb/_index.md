Labour market training, arbetsmarknadsutbildning, makes job seekers more attractive on the relevant labour market. The training is often tailor made together with a specific employer and often leads directly to a job. 
The training programme is provided by various training companies around the country, on our behalf. 

### What    
Arbetsmarknadsutbildning is a short vocational training programme for occupations where there is a shortage of trained people. 
There is also another type of vocational training aiming at those further from the labour market. 

##### There are two types of education:  
 
•	Labour market education aimed at leading to a job. The training is often tailor made together with a specific employer and often leads directly to a job.

•	And partly preparatory courses that can have varying contents of, for example, guiding and motivational character. They can also contain parts that aim to investigate areas of interest, suitable professions and paths to studies. 
The idea of all preparatory courses is to be a step ahead of the next planning and often constitute a part of a planned chain.
