The purpose of JobTech Taxonomy is to provide a relevant vocabulary for important elements in the language for the labour market.

JobTech Taxonomy contains concepts that describe, among other things, occupations, skills and relationships between them, 
which can be used for example as a basis for matching. The content is continuously updated in consultation with actors in the labour market.

## Paradigm of the Future
Our aim is for the labour market terminology observed via text analysis and data collection should help enrich the content of JobTech Taxonomy - but not without quality assurance. 
We believe that optimal results are achieved when a data driven approach meets an expert driven.
